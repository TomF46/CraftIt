I'm aware of the issues with how images are stored in this application, because of this being an example of c# code using .Net with no plan of deploying this somewhere i decided against using the method i have regularly used.

This method is to store uploaded images in an AWS s3 bucket and then store references to these files in the database, then when an image is requested i can use this reference to create a pre signed url which is returned to the user.


I'am also aware of the issue with storing Db information and secrets in github and would instead use token injection to inject these strings in a real world setting.
